		\subsection{Associativity v.\ Commutativity}
			VARIK accidentally and incorrectly substitutes ``associativity'' for ``commutativity''.
	\section{Associativity v.\ Commutativity}
		In one video, VARIK claims that $n + m$ equals $m + n$ because $+$ is associative.  Although $+$ is associative, the associativity of $+$ does not explain $n + m = m + n$.  VARIK actually should have stated that $+$ is \textit{commutative} --- for all operations $\circ : \mathbb J^2 \mapsto \mathbb K$, (for all $J \in \mathbb J^2$, $J_1 \circ J_2 = J_2 \circ J_2$) iff $\circ$ is commutative.
